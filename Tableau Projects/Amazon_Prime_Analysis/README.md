I'm thrilled to share my latest Tableau dashboard, which provides an in-depth analysis of Amazon Prime Video content. This interactive dashboard showcases the power of data visualization in uncovering key insights and trends.

## Key Highlights:
- Total Shows by Country: Visual representation of the geographical distribution of shows, highlighting key markets.
- Top 10 Genres: Bar chart displaying the most popular genres, with Drama leading the pack.
- Top Ratings: Radial bar chart illustrating the distribution of show ratings.
- Shows by Type: Donut chart breaking down the content type into TV shows and movies.
- Shows by Release Year: Line chart showcasing the trend of content released over the years, indicating a significant rise in recent years.

## What I Learned:
- Connecting to diverse data sources like Excel, Google Sheets, and cloud servers.
- Creating various chart types, including bar charts, line charts, donut charts, maps, tables, and dual-axis charts.
- Developing calculated fields and understanding Level of Detail (LOD) calculations.
- Utilising dashboard actions to enhance interactivity and creating dynamic dashboards with daily updates from Google Sheets.
